# Musical Reveal

Simple JSON interface to define audio synchronized slideshow over [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)



## Getting started

1. Building the library
  * Run `yarn install` to fetch JS dependencies
  * Run `yarn build` to produce minify library
2. Dev mode
  * After dependencies are installed run `yarn dev`. This starts a non-minified JS compilation watcher



## Example app

After building, start static webserver in the `app/` directory.
